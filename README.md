# N-plus-K-Queens

This is similar to the N Queens problem, with an added complexity of having pawns on the board. 
Each pair of queens on the same row, column, or diagonal can attack each other, if there is no piece in between them.
The pawns block the queens from attacking each other. However, they themselves do not attack any other piece. 

In this repository, there are three solutions to the problem each using a different search technique.
* Depth First Search
* Breadth First Search
* Simulated Annealing
